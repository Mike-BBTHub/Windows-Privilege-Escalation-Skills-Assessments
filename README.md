During a penetration test against the INLANEFREIGHT organization, you encounter a non
domain joined Windows server host that suffers from an unpatched command injection
vulnerability. After gaining a foothold, you come across credentials that may be useful for
lateral movement later in the assessment and uncover another flaw that can be leveraged to
escalate privileges on the target host.
For this assessment, assume that your client has a relatively mature patch/vulnerability
management program but is understaffed and unaware of many of the best practices around
configuration management, which could leave a host open to privilege escalation.
Enumerate the host (starting with an Nmap port scan to identify accessible ports/services),
leverage the command injection flaw to gain reverse shell access, escalate privileges to 
NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
 level or similar access, and answer the questions below to complete this
portion of the assessment.
